		<h2>Stats</h2>
			<p>Pokemon have 6 base stats these are Health(Hp),Attack(Atk),Defense(Def),Special Attack(Sp.Atk),Special Defense(Sp.Def),Speed(Spd)</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Health</h3>
				<p>This stat is how much life your Pokemon has, the higher your Pokemon Hp stat is the more damage that the Pokemon can take an example of 
				a Pokemon with a high base Hp is <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/blissey/" target="_blank">Blissy</a> while a Pokemon with a low base Hp is <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/shuckle/" target="_blank">shuckle</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Attack</h3>
				<p>The Attack stat is what a Pokemon Physical type attack moves scales off of you will see what physical attacks are on the next page but
				for now they are attacks that use your attack stat to scale up in power the higher this stat the stronger a physical attack will be a Pokemon with a high attack stat is <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/deoxys-attack/" target="_blank">Deoxys-A</a>
				While a low attack stat Pokemon would be <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/Pokemon/happiny/" target="_blank">Happiny</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Defense</h3>
				<p>The Defense stat is what takes away damage from physical attacks the higher the Defense the less damage that Pokemon takes from physical attacks 
				 a Pokemon with high defense is  <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/shuckle/" target="_blank">shuckle</a> while a Pokemon with low defense would be <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/chansey/" target="_blank">Chansey</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Special Attack</h3>
				<p>Sp.Atk scales up your Special attack moves these are again talked about in the move page but for now these are moves that scale up in power based on how high your 
				Sp.Atk stat is Pokemon with a high Sp.Atk would be <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/alakazam/" target="_blank">Alakazam</a> while a low Sp.Atk stat Pokemon would be <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/feebas/" target="_blank">Feebas.</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Special Defense</h3>
				<p>The Sp.Def stat is the stat the blocks special attacks the higher the stat is the more damage is negated by special attacks a Pokemon with high Sp.Def
				Would be  <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/shuckle/" target="_blank">shuckle</a> while a Pokemon with low Sp.def is <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/Pokemon/magikarp/" target="_blank">Magikarp</a>.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Speed</h3>
				<p>The Spd stat is how fast your Pokemon is this means will your Pokemon attack fist or second if your Pokemon has a high spd stat then they will 
				most likely attack first but if your Pokemon's spd is low they will attack second most likely a Pokemon with high speed is <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/aerodactyl/" target="_blank">Aerodactyl</a> but with low speed is 
				<a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/Pokemon/snorlax/" target="_blank">Snorlax</a></p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>what it Means</h3>
				<p> When building a team a major worry should be your Pokemon's stats you want Pokemon that can take hits with high Sp.Def and high Def while Pokemon that can deal allot of damage with
				high Atk or Sp.Atk in the Pokemon Roles page you can see more in-depth of what these stats mean and how a Pokemon's stats correlate to their role. When looking at Pokemon try to 
				look for Pokemon with a total stat count of at least 500 you can go lower than that in total if the Pokemon has really high stats in areas that correlate like 
				high speed and high attack that way that Pokemon can deal damage rapidly but they wont be able to defend with out being balanced with a high total stat.</p>
