		<h2>Ability's</h2>
			<p>These are special traits that a Pokemon can have that can either boost move strength help the Pokemon's status or affect the opposing Pokemon. There are tons of 
			abilities that a Pokemon can have I will not list all the abilities but you can find them here <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ability" target="_blank">bulbapedia.net</a> this also
			tells you what each one does</p>
			<p>Pokemon have abilities that are sometimes rarer than others for that specific Pokemon and abilities. Gliscor can have the ability poison heal where if that Pokemon
			is poisoned then instead of taking damage they heal, abilities like that one can change the flow of a game and vastly increase you Pokemon's chance of winning. These are  another
			necessary part of a building your team getting the ability your Pokemon has right so the link that shows all the abilities will be helpful when deciding what team you want and what
			you want your team to accomplish.</p>
			<p>A Pokemon cannot change their ability unless either you breed a new Pokemon or use a abilities capsule that can only be obtained throughout the battle tower
			but the abilities capsule will not give you the Pokemon's hidden abilities. To obtain the hidden the ability you have to catch a Pokemon that has it other wise there
			is no breeding that abilities into a Pokemon with out the mother or father already having that abilities.</p>
