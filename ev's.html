		<h2>EV's/IV's</h2>
			<p>EV's are points you can put into your Pokemon's stats to increase them but there is a max each Pokemon gets a max of 510 EV's they can put into a Pokemon but the 
			stats can only hold 252 total meaning you can max out two and put a few in others or you can spread them out amongst that stats fairly evenly</p>
			<p>IV's are points a Pokemon is born with, its equivalent to genes with these each stat can max out at 31 IV's and they also help to increase the base stats of a Pokemon like
			EV's do but they cant be changed or increased throughout the game on that Pokemon you have to breed a new one to get a Pokemon with different IV's</p>
			<section>
			<h3>Whats Important</h3>
			<p>When it comes to competitive battling increasing stats is very important and EV training your Pokemon is at the top of the list of what needs to be done for a 
			competitive team. When EV training you would want to put most points into the stats that help to fulfill their roles. IV's don't help as much as EV's do at LVL 50 a Pokemon's stat only goes up by 2 with perfect IV's 
			in that stat and getting a Pokemon with perfect IV's is very time consuming but you can if so inclined.</p>
