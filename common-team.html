		<h2>Common Team Types</h2>
			<p>In competitive Pokemon play there are 3 main types of teams these are offensive,stall, and balanced teams these are broken down into teams that
			represent the overall base of these but differ in form and function.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Offensive</h3>
				<p>This type of team is primarily out to dish damage fast so would contain Pokemon with roles in baton passing and sweepers since that way the can
				enhance their Pokemon with the baton pass. Then use their sweeper to take the enemy out since their strategy is highly damage dealing based having a your
				Pokemon that deals the most damage injured would be bad so this team would also most likely have a cleric on it to help keep your sweeper alive.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Stall</h3>
				<p>This team type is a team that is highly defensive the strategy here is to get Pokemon that can take hits and cause allot of status damage. These types of pokemon
				tend to be in the role of wall, tank, trapper, cleric, and stall-breaker these teams will have a attack type Pokemon on them just encase but mainly they are there to outlive
				the other team while they get hurt by statuses like poison and burn.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Balanced</h3>
				<p>A balanced team is a team that is equal offense as it is defense giving this team type a very wide range of roles of Pokemon it can chose from since as long as the
				team has both offense and defense Pokemon then the roles for the Pokemon can vary greatly giving a wide amount of different team variations.</p>
