			<h2>Reason for a Competitive Team</h2>
			<p>Today competitive Pokemon is one of the biggest fields of the Pokemon game you have collectors, competitive players, and story liners. Competitive play though unlike the 
			other two means that you have to fight real people and come up with a team to beat them thats what I am here to help with.Each page will cover a different aspect of 
			how to build a team. One of the top considerations for building a team is Pokemon type there are a total of 18 different Pokemon types and they correspond to each other on different
			ways.Competitive play Pokemon can refer to playing against the in game battle tower to playing in pro Pokemon competitions for money and everything in between
			but even if your just battling in game CPU's you still need a strong team to get far in the battle tower like you would to get far in a real tournament against others.
			Within the realm of competitive battling there are different types of battles but the most prominent ones are single battles(one on one) or double battles (two on two).</p>
