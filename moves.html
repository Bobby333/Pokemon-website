	<h2>Moves</h2>
		<p>In the Pokemon universe there are several different types of moves that can be used these are physical attacks, special attacks, status effects, these are the types of
		moves that you have to take into account then the range of the attack matters for battling as well as what the typing of the move is. </p>
		<section>
			<h3>Physical Attacks</h3>
			<p>These types of attacks scale of your Pokemon's attack stat and can be lessened in damage by the opponents Pokemon's defense stat 
			when it comes to these types of moves you want to teach them to Pokemon that have a high basic attack stat. To tell if a move is a Physical attacks
			This symbol will appear on the moves description page.<img  src="Physical.png" alt=null></p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Special Attacks</h3>
			<p>With Special attacks these tend to scale off your Pokemon's special attack stat and the higher that stat for the Pokemon is the the more damage this type 
			of move is capable of doing but the opponents Pokemon's special defense stat can lower the amount of damage this move can deal to them. The icon to differentiate this 
			type of move from a physical attack or status effect is.<img  src="Special.png" alt=null></p>

		<section>
			<h3>Status effect</h3>
			<p>These moves do not scale off any stat that a Pokemon has they are used to weaken the opponents Pokemon or effect that negatively affect the Pokemon through out the battle
			while they can also be used to boost your own Pokemon's stats or health these are as necessary to a team as the other two types of moves above. Like the two other
			types of Pokemon above these moves do work best on a certain type of Pokemon those would be your tank wall type Pokemon because they are able to withstand attacks to 
			gets these types of moves off to help your other Pokemon that maybe cant survive attacks like your tank can.The icon for this type of move is.<img  src="Status.png" alt="Status effect icon"></p> 
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Choosing Moves</h3>
			<p>Now that we covered the types of moves we have to cover how to chose the moves you want your Pokemon to learn. To start out each move has a type that corresponds to it
			so when deciding what to teach your Pokemon try to match up a move type to your Pokemon type this way they can deal extra damage because of whats called STAB and thats when
			a moves type matches a Pokemon type that move will do x2 damage. A Pokemon though should not know only moves that match their type or they will be at a disadvantage to Pokemon
			who are strong against or even resist that type of move so mix it up try to add a move that fits both your Pokemon's stats and counters the type that counters your Pokemon
			an example is Charizard is a fire type Pokemon that would benefit from learning a grass type move like solar beam since that move is capable of hurting water type Pokemon allot more then 
			a fire type attack would be. Having a Pokemon team full of only damage dealing moves like Special and physical attacks is a bad idea try to get some of your Pokemon
			to know different status moves maybe moves that removes status effects like poison or moves that hurt your opponent by poisoning them or lowering their stats but there is no set status move that 
			every team should have since each team can function differently.Then lastly for moves worry about what type of battles you want to do if your doing double battles moves like surf and earthquake
			aren't worth getting since they will hurt your partners Pokemon a long with the enemy and that is more of a down side than helpful but there are moves like psychic and dazzling gleam 
			that will hit both the opponents Pokemon with out hurting your partners Pokemon so when planing out your attack moves worry about what type of battling you are going for.On the Pokemon roles
			page you will see specific examples of status moves and where their use comes into play for your team.</p>
