		`			<p> The Pokemon listed aren't the only ones that can fit these roles but are examples. In the move category N/A refers to roles that don't have 
						specific moves to there roles but the moves given also don't show the only moves that go well with that role.</p>

				<h2>Deciding the roles</h2>
				<p>When deciding what roles of Pokemon you want to use try to keep your team of six each having a different role and try to match roles to what would work best
				together like a baton passer and a sweeper would work well since the baton passer can power up a sweeper to be able to deal even more damage to the enemy team.
				Then another example to two roles that would work well would be a cleric and a stall-breaker since the cleric could help to keep a stall-breaker alive and continue breaking up 
				the enemy's strategy.This is a area that you have to decide what kind of roles you want on your team.</p>
